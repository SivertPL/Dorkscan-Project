# Dorkscan BETA

Dorkscan is a brand-new tool for mass scanning written from scratch in Python3.
Inspired by d4rkd0rk3r and v3n0m, but made with great care and patience.
It is very useful for testing security of gathered websites against SQL Injection attacks (and many more soon!).

## What you hold

- Faster, more reliable and better than V3n0m when it comes to both testing and gathering URLs.
- Improved error heuristics based on sqlmap's detection engine, adopted and modified to suit your needs.
- You only get what you really need - no unnecessary crapware. 
- Almost zero false positives!
- Ability to save scanning results to a textfile.
- Better UI made with curses.
- Free, open source, and cross-platform.
- Not abandonware and constantly improving.

### How to use

```
$ python3 main.py domain amount
```

### Requirements

You need to have the following installed with pip3 in order to use Dorkscan:

```
curses
asyncio
aiohttp
urllib2
re
requests
html
```
